# Docker Compose Configuration for Fullstack Application
# Provides modern features including health checks and custom networks

services:
  # Backend Service - FastAPI Application
  backend:
    # Build configuration
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    
    # Container naming for easy identification
    container_name: fastapi-backend
    
    # Port mapping: Host:Container
    # Maps host port 8000 to container port 8000 for API access
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    
    # Environment variables for backend configuration
    environment:
      # Prevents Python from buffering stdout/stderr, ensuring logs appear immediately
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
      # Additional environment variables can be added here for development
      # Example: - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/dbname
    
    # Volume mounts for development hot reload
    # Binds local backend directory to container /app directory
    # This allows code changes to be reflected immediately without rebuilding
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
    
    # Network configuration
    # Connects service to the custom bridge network for inter-service communication
    networks:
      - app-network
    
    # Restart policy: Automatically restart container unless explicitly stopped
    # Ensures service availability in case of failures
    restart: unless-stopped
    
    # Health check configuration
    # Docker will periodically check if the backend is healthy
    healthcheck:
      # Command to test service health
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      # Time between health checks
      interval: 30s
      # Maximum time to wait for health check response
      timeout: 10s
      # Number of consecutive failures before marking as unhealthy
      retries: 3
      # Initial delay before starting health checks (allows app to start)
      start_period: 40s

  # Frontend Service - React + Vite Application (served by Nginx)
  frontend:
    # Build configuration
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    
    # Container naming for easy identification
    container_name: react-frontend
    
    # Port mapping: Host:Container
    # Maps host port 3000 to container port 80 (Nginx serves on port 80 internally)
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    
    # Service dependencies
    # Ensures backend starts before frontend
    # Frontend can communicate with backend via service name 'backend'
    depends_on:
      - backend
    
    # Network configuration
    # Connects service to the custom bridge network for inter-service communication
    networks:
      - app-network
    
    # Restart policy: Automatically restart container unless explicitly stopped
    restart: unless-stopped
    
    # Health check configuration
    # Docker will periodically check if the frontend is serving content
    healthcheck:
      # Command to test service health using wget
      # --no-verbose: Reduces output noise
      # --tries=1: Only attempt once
      # --spider: Don't download, just check if page exists
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:80"]
      # Time between health checks
      interval: 30s
      # Maximum time to wait for health check response
      timeout: 10s
      # Number of consecutive failures before marking as unhealthy
      retries: 3
      # Initial delay before starting health checks
      start_period: 40s

# Network configuration
networks:
  # Custom bridge network for service-to-service communication
  # Enables service discovery: services can reach each other using service names
  # Example: Frontend can call http://backend:8000/api/hello
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
    # Bridge driver creates an isolated network for the application
    # All services on this network can communicate with each other
    # but are isolated from other Docker networks
